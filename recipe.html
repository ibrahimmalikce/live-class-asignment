    <h1>My recipe for jollof rice</h1>
    <p>
      Nigerian Jollof Rice is a vibrant, flavorful West African dish made with
      rice simmered in a rich blend of tomatoes, peppers, onions, and aromatic
      spices. Known for its bright red color and smoky, savory taste, it’s a
      party favorite often served with fried plantains, grilled chicken, or
      salad. This one-pot wonder is not only delicious but also a symbol of
      celebration and togetherness in Nigerian homes.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Blend the base</strong>
        <p>
          Blend tomatoes, red bell peppers, scotch bonnets, and half of the
          onion into a smooth paste.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Parboil rice</strong>
        <p>
          Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Parboil for
          about 5 minutes, then drain and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the sauce</strong>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a pot, add chopped onions, and fry until translucent. Stir
          in tomato paste and fry for 3–5 minutes to reduce sourness. Add
          blended pepper mix and cook on medium heat for 15–20 minutes, stirring
          often until oil separates from the sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season the sauce</strong>
        <p>
          Add thyme, curry powder, seasoning cubes, bay leaves, and salt. Stir
          well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add stock and rice</strong>
        <p>
          Pour in chicken stock, bring to a boil, then add the parboiled rice.
          Stir so the rice is evenly coated with the sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steam, don’t stir too much</strong>
        <p>
          Cover the pot tightly (you can use foil to trap steam). Reduce heat to
          low and let it cook for 20–30 minutes until rice is tender.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Final touches</strong>
        <p>
          Stir gently from bottom to top to mix. If needed, sprinkle a little
          water, cover, and steam for 5 more minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve</strong>
        <p>Serve hot with fried plantain, grilled chicken, or salad.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tip</h2>
    <p>
      For that authentic “party jollof” smoky flavor, let the rice cook on low
      heat and allow it to slightly toast at the bottom of the pot just enough
      to give a smoky aroma without burning too much.
